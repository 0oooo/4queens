# Four Queens Game

In the game you have a board that is 4 by 4. You need to put 4 queens on the board without them eating each other. 

This is a very simple implementation with a player on the command line. 

# Todo 

- Add a system that detects when the participants has lost after putting the 3rd queen

- Add a system to start again, whenever the player wants

- Add a system that solves it automatically
